 * # why we need a database?
 * We are saving data in text files but there are some limitation
 * 1. text file is not secured
 * 2. concurrency is not provided
 * 3. no proper structure or guideline
 * 4. anybody can modify / delete the data
 * 5. every user can have there own data file
 * 6. difficult to manage and keep track of these data file
 *
 *
 * What is a database?
 * 1. A filed is an information of an object
 * 2. Group of field will form a record
 * 3. Groud of records are in table
 * 4. group of tables are in database or RDBMS
 *
 * For Example:
 * Employee
 *   Id
 *   Name
 *   Age
 *   Address
 *   Salary
 *
 * Records
 * 1 Mark  30   India   20000 - record
 *
 *
 *
 * Table
 * 1 Mark  30   India   20000
 * 1 Mark  30   India   20000
 * 1 Mark  30   India   20000
 *
 * A database is a collection of table
 *
 * # Type Data
 * 1. Structured Data - table
 * 2. Semi - Structured Data - JSON object
 * 3. UnStructured Data - pictures, video, pdf, file
 *
 *
 * # Database can further categorized into 2 main category
 * 1. Structural Database - RDBMS - SQL Database - MS SQL, MySQL, Oracle etc
 * 2. Semi-Structured - NoSQL Database - MongoDB, Cassandra, Redis etc
 *
 *
 * # Advantages of RDBMS
 * 1. Related group of fields are formed as table which is easy to understand
 * 2. Many users can access the table simultanesously
 * 3. Many user can create database or add / manipulate data and we can
 *    restrict the access by providing access prviledge
 * 4. The database can be placed on centralized server and can be accesssed
 *    everyone
 * 5. RDBMS gives the best performance in terms of speed and that to depend
 *    upon type and amount of data
 * 6. MySQL, MS SQL, Oracle
 * 7. SQL (Structured Query Language) is used to perform operation in RDBMS
 *
 *
 * # SQL
 * 1. SQL stands for Structured Query Language
 * 2. It is the language used in RDBMS to perform operation on DB
 * 3. It is easy to learn and understand
 * 4. User can perform create table, insert
 *
 * CURD
 * C - create
 * U - update
 * R - Read
 * D - Delete
 *
 *
 * # SQL Command
 * 1. DDL - Data Defination Language
 * 2. DML - Data Manipulation
 * 3. DQL - Data Query
