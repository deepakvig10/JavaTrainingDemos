 *  when we want to take the responsibilty to create the object of the exception class
 *  we can use throw keyword with system define exception classes or with user define exception classes
 *
 * Important
 * Every class cannot be throw
 * It should be throwable
 * only exception class can be thrown
 * we can create a class which extend from RuntimeException, Throwable, Exception
